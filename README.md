# Collaboration Instructions

1. Use CDN Always
1. Include those CDNs properly in index.html, not in angularcli.json | .css files itself
1. Use Linting
1. Use VS Code's Prettier, TSLint
1. For placeholder non clickable links use javascript:void(0)
1. Always format your code before pushing
1. Use ./assets in html or ts side, but in css, you have to use the whole relative path
1. Stop making all variables private that you want to access in template side, it's invalid and prevents compilation for production
